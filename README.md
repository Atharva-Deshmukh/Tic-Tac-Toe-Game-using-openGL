What is a Tic Tac Toe game?

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. 

The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
An opponent can prevent a win by blocking the completion of the opponent's line. 
In our variant of the game, players placed objects on a board.
